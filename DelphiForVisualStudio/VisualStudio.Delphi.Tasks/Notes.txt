DCC32 object will be the options holder.

The VisualStudio.Delpi.Tasks.DLL holds the abstract object
named TDelphiCompilerTool that all Delphi compiler command 
line tools task will inheret from.  The name of the task
can be anything as the base object helps compile Delphi
projects but does not know what type of Delphi projects
like .NET or Win32.
TDelphiCompilerTool has feature like building the command
line based on properites that have the attribute CompilerCommand.


All Delphi for Visual studio projects will import the abstract
target named VisualStudio.Delphi.Tasks.Targets.  This
Targets file will use the project properties "DelphiCompiler" and
"DelphiCompilerVersion" along with the optional "CompilerTargetsPath"
to build the full location and filename of the compiler Targets
file. 
(Example: 
$(CompilerTargetsPath)VisualStudio.Delphi.Tasks.$(DelphiCompiler).$(DelphiCompilerVersion).Targets
)

Each Delphi command line compiler Targets file will have a compile task and
the Target named "Build" with DependsOnTargets="$(BuildDependencies)".
