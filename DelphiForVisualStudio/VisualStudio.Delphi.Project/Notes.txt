- <Fixed> Renaming a .PAS files causes and error when checked in but works but not of child file nodes (.DFM) 
- <Fixed> Project is not checked out when modified (adding item like folder or rename of file) because it is not marked as readonly
- <Fixed> Renaming of delphi Pas and dfm files do not function

- Only one DPR can exist in project
- Items like folders and files do not have a delete context menu item
- Saving of the DPR should refresh VS project

- Check Project automation for access to .NET References
- Custom tool is needed for dependent files.
